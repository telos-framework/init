## Why

The current initialization process requires users to manually answer 8+ detailed
questions about their project's purpose hierarchy (L9→L1), including highly
technical lower-layer concerns (L1-L4: code structure, function logic, component
design, API contracts). This creates two problems:

1. **Cognitive burden**: Users must deeply understand the 9-level abstraction
   hierarchy and formulate purpose statements for technical layers that are
   better auto-discovered
2. **Underutilized AI capability**: Telos is designed to work with AI coding
   assistants (Claude Code, OpenCode, Cursor) that can already analyze codebases
   and infer purpose—yet we force manual question-answering instead of
   leveraging this

By implementing Telos as **slash command-driven** with the CLI serving only as
an installer, we transform initialization from a CLI interrogation into an
AI-native collaborative discovery: Claude analyzes the codebase, proposes the
hierarchy, and the user refines strategic layers.

## What Changes

- **Slash command-first architecture**: All Telos functionality exposed through
  slash commands (`/telos-init`, `/telos-validate`, `/telos-status`, etc.) that
  Claude/AI assistants execute directly
- **CLI as installer only**: `telos init` becomes a lightweight installer that:
  - Copies slash command definitions to `.claude/commands/telos/`
  - Sets up AGENTS.md and CLAUDE.md with Telos instructions
  - Ensures proper directory structure for platform compatibility
  - Then tells user to run `/telos-init` to complete setup
- **AI-native codebase analysis**: The `/telos-init` slash command prompt
  instructs Claude to scan the project (README, package.json, code structure,
  tooling) and propose a complete Telos hierarchy
- **Auto-generated L1-L4**: Technical layers (Syntax-Linter, Function-Author,
  Component-Architect, Integration-Contractor) are inferred by Claude from
  detected patterns—no user prompts needed
- **Strategic review for L5-L9**: Claude presents proposed strategic layers
  (Journey-Validator, UX-Simulator, Insight-Synthesizer, Market-Analyst,
  Telos-Guardian) and asks user for refinements
- **Generated artifacts**: `/telos-init` creates `telos/content/TELOS.md`,
  `telos/agents/l1-l9-*.md`, and platform-specific configurations
- **Plugin distribution**: Package as a Claude Code/OpenCode plugin for easy
  installation via `/plugin marketplace add`

## Impact

**Affected specs:**

- `telos-initialization` (MODIFIED) - Reimplemented as slash command with CLI
  installer
- `agent-framework` (MODIFIED) - L1-L4 agents generated by Claude based on
  analysis

**Affected code:**

- `.claude/commands/telos/init.md` (NEW) - Main initialization slash command
- `.claude/commands/telos/validate.md` (NEW) - Validation slash command
- `.claude/commands/telos/status.md` (NEW) - Status check slash command
- `templates/AGENTS.md` (NEW) - Template for project's AGENTS.md file
- `templates/CLAUDE.md` (NEW) - Template for project's CLAUDE.md file
- `lib/commands/init.js` (MODIFIED) - Becomes installer, not interactive
  prompter
- `lib/installers/slash-commands.js` (NEW) - Copies command files to project
- `lib/installers/memory-files.js` (NEW) - Sets up AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md
- `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` (NEW) - Plugin manifest for marketplace
  distribution

**Breaking changes:**

- **BREAKING**: `telos init` no longer runs interactive prompts—now just
  installs slash commands
- **BREAKING**: User must run `/telos-init` after `telos init` to complete
  initialization
- Migration path: Clear messaging from CLI → "Next step: Run /telos-init"

**User journey:**

**Before (CLI-based):**

1. User runs `telos init` in terminal
2. Answers 4 Telos questions (purpose, beneficiaries, impact, constraints)
3. Answers 8 hierarchy questions (L8→L1 purpose statements)
4. System generates agents from JavaScript code

**After (Slash command-based):**

1. User runs `npm install -g telos-framework` (or
   `/plugin marketplace add telos/framework`)
2. User runs `telos init` in project directory
3. CLI installs slash commands to `.claude/commands/telos/`
4. CLI sets up AGENTS.md and CLAUDE.md templates
5. CLI displays: "✓ Telos commands installed. Next: Run /telos-init to complete
   setup"
6. User opens project in Claude Code (or already has it open)
7. User runs `/telos-init` command
8. Claude analyzes codebase and proposes full hierarchy (L9→L1 with reasoning)
9. Claude asks: "Review L9-L5 strategic layers. Would you like to refine any?"
10. User provides feedback on strategic layers only
11. Claude generates all Telos files (TELOS.md, 9 agent definitions,
    configurations)
12. User is ready to develop with full multi-agent system

**Key improvements:**

- Setup time: ~10 minutes → ~3 minutes (1 min CLI install + 2 min AI-driven
  setup)
- User effort: 12 detailed answers → ~2-3 strategic refinements
- Separation of concerns: CLI handles file installation, AI handles intelligent
  discovery
- Flexibility: Can install commands once, run `/telos-init` multiple times to
  refine
