# Proposal Revision Summary

## Changes Made Based on Feedback

This revision updates the `implement-telos-multi-agent-system` proposal based on
two critical insights:

### 1. Leverage OpenSpec Instead of Custom Spec System

**Previous Approach:** The proposal included building a custom "Spec-Driven
Dialogue Protocol" with custom spec translation, lineage tracking, and archiving
logic.

**Revised Approach:** Full integration with OpenSpec
(https://github.com/Fission-AI/OpenSpec) as the specification system:

- **Logos Orchestrator Uses OpenSpec**: When Logos determines work is needed, it
  creates OpenSpec change proposals using `/openspec:proposal` command or
  natural language
- **OpenSpec Task Execution**: Agents work through tasks defined in
  `openspec/changes/<change-id>/tasks.md`
- **OpenSpec Validation**: Use `openspec validate --strict` instead of custom
  validation
- **OpenSpec Archive**: Use `openspec archive` to merge completed changes into
  source specs
- **OpenSpec Directory Structure**: Maintain `openspec/specs/` (source of truth)
  and `openspec/changes/` (proposals)
- **No Custom Spec System**: Removed all custom spec translation, validation,
  and archive logic

**What Changed:**

- Renamed `spec-driven-dialogue` spec to `openspec-integration`
- Completely rewrote openspec-integration/spec.md with 10 requirements focused
  on OpenSpec CLI integration
- Added explicit "No Custom Spec System" requirement
- Logos orchestrator now invokes OpenSpec commands via subprocess
- All specs use OpenSpec format with optional Telos metadata in markdown

### 2. Bring Along Technical Agents from Claude-Collective

**Previous Approach:** Only the 9-level Telos agents (L1-L9) with no delegation
mechanism for specialized technical work.

**Revised Approach:** 9-level agents can delegate to proven technical agents
from claude-code-sub-agent-collective:

**Technical Agents Imported:**

- **research-agent** - Context7-powered documentation and best practice research
- **quality-agent** - Security analysis, code review, compliance checking
- **devops-agent** - CI/CD, deployment, infrastructure configuration
- **prd-research-agent** - Intelligent PRD analysis and task generation
- **testing-implementation-agent** - Comprehensive test suite generation
- **component-implementation-agent** - UI component implementation with TDD
- **feature-implementation-agent** - Business logic implementation with TDD
- **infrastructure-implementation-agent** - Build systems and tooling
- **polish-implementation-agent** - Performance optimization
- **functional-testing-agent** - Real browser E2E testing with Playwright

**Delegation Examples:**

- L2 Function-Author delegates to testing-implementation-agent for comprehensive
  test coverage
- L8 Market-Analyst delegates to research-agent for current market data via
  Context7
- L4 Integration-Contractor delegates to quality-agent for security review
- L5 Journey-Validator delegates to functional-testing-agent for Playwright E2E
  tests
- L3 Component-Architect delegates to component-implementation-agent for UI
  implementation

**What Changed:**

- Added `technical-agent-library` spec with 13 requirements
- Defined delegation protocol between Telos agents and technical agents
- Technical agents adapted to work within Telos philosophical framework
- Technical agents receive Telos context and alignment information
- Excluded claude-collective's /van routing (using Logos orchestrator instead)
- Hub-and-spoke architecture maintained with Logos as hub (not /van)

## Key Architectural Changes

### Before:

```
User Request → Logos → 9-Level Agents → Custom Specs → Custom Validation → Custom Archive
```

### After:

```
User Request → Logos → OpenSpec Proposal → 9-Level Agents → Technical Agents (delegate)
                                                    ↓
                                              OpenSpec Tasks
                                                    ↓
                                         OpenSpec Validate --strict
                                                    ↓
                                          OpenSpec Archive --yes
```

## Benefits of Revisions

### OpenSpec Integration Benefits:

1. **No Reinventing the Wheel**: Leverage proven, actively-maintained spec
   system
2. **Broader Compatibility**: OpenSpec supports 15+ AI platforms natively
3. **Better Tooling**: CLI commands (list, show, validate, archive) already
   built
4. **Community Support**: Active Discord, frequent updates, growing adoption
5. **Simpler Implementation**: Subprocess calls instead of building spec engine
6. **Proven Workflows**: Brownfield-first design handles evolving codebases
7. **Reduced Complexity**: ~1000 lines of custom spec code eliminated

### Technical Agent Delegation Benefits:

1. **Proven Patterns**: Agents battle-tested in claude-collective production use
2. **Specialized Expertise**: Each agent deeply specialized (security, devops,
   testing, etc.)
3. **TDD Methodology**: Built-in RED→GREEN→REFACTOR enforcement
4. **Context7 Integration**: research-agent provides up-to-date library docs
5. **Reduced Development Time**: Import and adapt vs build from scratch
6. **Quality Assurance**: quality-agent catches issues early
7. **Better Separation**: 9-level agents focus on ontological concerns, delegate
   technical details

## Implementation Impact

### Reduced Scope:

- **Remove**: Custom spec translation logic (~300 lines)
- **Remove**: Custom spec validation engine (~400 lines)
- **Remove**: Custom spec archiving logic (~300 lines)
- **Remove**: Custom lineage tracking (~200 lines)
- **Add**: OpenSpec subprocess integration (~100 lines)
- **Net**: ~1100 lines removed, ~100 added

### New Scope:

- **Add**: Technical agent import and adaptation (~500 lines)
- **Add**: Delegation protocol implementation (~300 lines)
- **Add**: Agent routing updates for delegation (~200 lines)
- **Net**: ~1000 lines new functionality

### Overall: ~100 lines net reduction with significantly more capability

## Validation Status

- ✅ Proposal validates:
  `openspec validate implement-telos-multi-agent-system --strict`
- ✅ 8 capability specs (was 7)
- ✅ All specs follow OpenSpec format
- ✅ 10 new requirements in openspec-integration
- ✅ 13 new requirements in technical-agent-library
- ✅ Clear delegation protocols defined
- ✅ No custom spec system (explicit requirement)

## Next Steps

1. **Review openspec-integration/spec.md** - Ensure OpenSpec integration
   requirements are complete
2. **Review technical-agent-library/spec.md** - Validate delegation patterns and
   agent list
3. **Update tasks.md** - Adjust tasks to reflect OpenSpec integration (less
   custom code)
4. **Update design.md** - Document OpenSpec architecture decisions
5. **Implementation** - Begin with Phase 1 (infrastructure) per updated tasks
