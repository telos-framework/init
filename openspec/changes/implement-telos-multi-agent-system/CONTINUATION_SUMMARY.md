This continuation session completed the `implement-telos-multi-agent-system`
proposal by adding comprehensive specification coverage across all capability
areas.

### New Capability Specs Created

1. **logos-orchestrator** (spec.md)
   - Orchestrator state management and session persistence
   - Top-down decomposition flow (L9→L1)
   - Bottom-up validation cascade (L1→L9)
   - Middle-out reconciliation for conflicts
   - Agent isolation and structured communication
   - Handoff protocol with loop detection
   - Parallel agent coordination
   - Session continuity across interruptions

2. **agent-framework** (spec.md)
   - Agent definition schema with standardized structure
   - Complete L1-L9 agent specifications:
     - L1: Syntax-Linter (linters, formatters)
     - L2: Function-Author (TDD, unit tests)
     - L3: Component-Architect (component integration)
     - L4: Integration-Contractor (API contracts)
     - L5: Journey-Validator (E2E testing)
     - L6: UX-Simulator (personas, accessibility)
     - L7: Insight-Synthesizer (analytics, feedback)
     - L8: Market-Analyst (business case, KPIs)
     - L9: Telos-Guardian (purpose alignment)
   - Agent prompt template system with Handlebars
   - Tool-conditional agent adaptations

3. **tool-integration** (spec.md)
   - MCP server discovery and capability extraction
   - Common tool detection (linters, test frameworks, analytics)
   - Capability-based tool mapping (abstract layer)
   - Graceful tool degradation and fallbacks
   - Tool re-discovery for evolving projects
   - Tool configuration management
   - MCP client integration for agents
   - Tool usage instrumentation and metrics

4. **platform-compatibility** (spec.md)
   - Platform detection (Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, Gemini)
   - Centralized content structure (single source of truth)
   - Symlink-based platform integration
   - Master AGENTS.md consolidation
   - Manual copy fallback for restricted environments
   - Platform-specific templates
   - Cross-platform compatibility testing
   - Platform evolution support (easy to add new platforms)

5. **spec-driven-dialogue** (spec.md)
   - OpenSpec extension with TELOS ALIGNMENT section
   - Spec translation between levels (L9→L8→...→L1)
   - Spec lineage tracking back to ultimate Telos
   - Validation cascade implementation
   - Spec-driven agent communication
   - Spec template library (feature, bug, refactor)
   - Conflict detection and resolution
   - Spec versioning and evolution

6. **repository-structure** (spec.md)
   - CLI implementation (telos init, status, validate, etc.)
   - Project initialization directory structure
   - Configuration management (.telos/config.json)
   - README and documentation generation
   - Example projects (web-app, legacy-integration)
   - Testing infrastructure and self-validation
   - MIT license and open source structure
   - Dependency management (minimal dependencies)
   - Version management (semver + changelog)
   - GitHub repository structure with CI/CD

### Enhanced Design Document

Added comprehensive "Additional Context from Claude Code Collective" section
covering:

**Installer Architecture Patterns:**

- NPM package with NPX support
- Express installation mode
- File mapping system
- Handlebars template processing
- Smart merge with backup strategy
- Post-install validation

**Directory Structure:**

- `.telos/` for runtime state (gitignored)
- `telos/` as source of truth (committed)
- Platform-specific symlinks
- Clear separation of concerns

**Key Learnings:**

- Decision flow separation (routing vs behavioral rules)
- Auto-delegation infrastructure (two-tier handoff)
- Hub-and-spoke architecture (no peer-to-peer)
- TDD contract enforcement
- Smart merge strategies
- Hooks system for behavioral enforcement
- Multi-layer testing infrastructure

**Adaptations for Telos:**

- What to adopt directly from claude-collective
- What to adapt for Telos-specific needs
- What to add (new to Telos beyond claude-collective)
- Implementation sequence informed by proven patterns

### Updated Proposal Metadata

**Specs Coverage:**

- 7 complete capability specs
- 60 total requirements
- 125 total scenarios
- ~1,400 lines of detailed specifications

**Enhanced Impact Section:**

- Added spec-driven-dialogue and repository-structure to affected specs list
- Maintained backward compatibility (no breaking changes)
- Clear dependencies and implementation sequence

## Alignment with Claude Collective Reference

The continuation integrated learnings from the claude-code-collective repository
(https://github.com/vanzan01/claude-code-sub-agent-collective) while adapting
for Telos-specific needs:

**Adopted Patterns:**

- ✅ NPM package with express installation mode
- ✅ File mapping system for template management
- ✅ Handlebars-based template processing
- ✅ Smart merge with automatic backups
- ✅ Hub-and-spoke orchestrator architecture
- ✅ Structured agent reporting protocol
- ✅ Auto-delegation infrastructure
- ✅ Validation system with diagnostics

**Telos-Specific Additions:**

- ✨ Interactive Telos discovery (L9 purpose capture)
- ✨ 9-level ontological hierarchy (vs flat specialized agents)
- ✨ Top-down decomposition + bottom-up validation flows
- ✨ Middle-out reconciliation (unique to Telos)
- ✨ Spec-driven dialogue with OpenSpec integration
- ✨ Telos alignment tracking throughout hierarchy
- ✨ Multi-platform symlink strategy (beyond Claude Code only)
- ✨ Tool-to-level capability mapping

## Next Steps

The proposal is now **validation-ready** and **implementation-ready** with:

1. ✅ Complete proposal.md with clear Why/What/Impact
2. ✅ Comprehensive design.md with architectural decisions
3. ✅ Detailed tasks.md with 12 phases and 101 tasks
4. ✅ 7 capability specs with 60 requirements and 125 scenarios
5. ✅ Reference implementation context from claude-collective
6. ✅ Validation passing:
   `openspec validate implement-telos-multi-agent-system --strict`

**Ready for:**

- Development kickoff following task sequence
- Parallel workstream execution per task dependencies
- Incremental delivery with validation at each phase
- Community review and feedback
