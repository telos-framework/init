## Why

Software development currently lacks a philosophical foundation that ensures
alignment between ultimate purpose (Telos) and implementation. Developers use AI
assistants reactively for isolated tasks rather than having a coherent,
purpose-driven development framework. This proposal implements the complete
Telos-driven Multi-Agent system described in initial.md—a framework that embeds
Aristotelian purpose hierarchy into a 9-level AI agent collective guided by
Logos (rational discourse) to ensure every line of code serves the ultimate
mission.

This framework transforms AI-assisted development from ad-hoc tool usage into a
systematic, philosophically-grounded methodology where specialized agents
operate at each ontological level (from syntax to transcendent purpose),
orchestrated through continuous top-down/bottom-up dialogue that maintains
coherence across all abstraction layers.

## What Changes

This is a foundational implementation creating an entirely new capability set:

- **Telos Initialization System**: Interactive discovery process that captures
  project purpose, creates hierarchical Telos structure (L9→L1), and adapts the
  framework to the user's specific context
- **9-Level Agent Architecture**: Complete implementation of specialized agents
  mapped to Boulding's hierarchy (Syntax-Linter, Function-Author,
  Component-Architect, Integration-Contractor, Journey-Validator, UX-Simulator,
  Insight-Synthesizer, Market-Analyst, Telos-Guardian)
- **Logos Orchestrator**: Central orchestration engine implementing
  orchestrator-worker pattern with top-down decomposition, bottom-up validation,
  and middle-out reconciliation flows using OpenSpec for change proposals and
  task management
- **Tool Discovery & Integration**: Comprehensive tool detection, MCP server
  integration, and adaptive agent prompt generation based on available tooling
- **Platform Compatibility Framework**: Generic content structure with
  symlink-based multi-platform support (Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, Gemini,
  etc.)
- **OpenSpec Integration**: Full integration with OpenSpec workflow - Logos
  orchestrator creates OpenSpec proposals, agents work through OpenSpec tasks,
  validation uses OpenSpec archive
- **Technical Agent Delegation**: 9-level agents can delegate to specialized
  technical agents from claude-collective (research-agent, quality-agent,
  devops-agent, prd-research-agent, testing-implementation-agent, etc.) for
  specific technical tasks
- **Repository Structure**: Complete project scaffolding with initialization
  CLI, documentation, examples, and MIT-licensed open-source release preparation

## Impact

**Affected specs:**

- `telos-initialization` (NEW) - Discovery and adaptation system
- `logos-orchestrator` (NEW) - Central orchestration engine with OpenSpec
  integration
- `agent-framework` (NEW) - 9-level specialized agent collective with technical
  agent delegation
- `tool-integration` (NEW) - MCP and tool discovery system
- `platform-compatibility` (NEW) - Multi-platform support via symlinks
- `openspec-integration` (NEW) - Full OpenSpec workflow integration (replaces
  custom spec system)
- `technical-agent-library` (NEW) - Claude-collective technical agents for
  delegation
- `technical-agent-library` (NEW) - Claude-collective technical agents for
  delegation
- `repository-structure` (NEW) - Project scaffolding and CLI implementation

**Affected code:**

- `/` - New root-level initialization scripts and CLI
- `/telos/` (NEW) - Core Telos capture and hierarchy management
- `/logos/` (NEW) - Orchestrator implementation and dialogue protocols
- `/agents/` (NEW) - All 9 specialized agent definitions
- `/tools/` (NEW) - Tool discovery and integration layer
- `/templates/` (NEW) - Platform-specific templates and symlink targets
- `README.md` - Complete usage documentation
- `AGENTS.md` - Updated to reference Telos system

**User Journey:**

1. User clones telos repo into their project
2. User runs `telos init` (or similar CLI command)
3. Interactive discovery captures: project telos, available tools/MCPs, existing
   code context, style preferences
4. System generates adapted agent prompts, tool configurations, and
   platform-specific symlinks
5. User begins development with full 9-level multi-agent system active
6. Logos orchestrator manages all coding tasks through spec-driven dialogue

**Breaking changes:** None (new capability, no existing functionality to break)

**Dependencies:**

- OpenSpec (already present)
- MCP protocol support (discover during init)
- File system symlink support (cross-platform consideration)
