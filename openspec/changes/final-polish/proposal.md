## Why

The Telos framework core implementation is complete with 95/129 tasks finished
(74%). Before the v0.1.1 release, we need to complete final polish items to
ensure a production-ready package.

Current state:

- ✅ Core framework (Sections 1-9) - 100% complete
- ✅ Documentation (Section 10) - 92% complete (9/10 tasks)
- ✅ Testing (Section 11) - 20% complete (2/10 tasks)
- ⏭️ Release preparation (Section 12) - 40% complete (4/10 tasks)

This proposal addresses the remaining high-priority polish items before npm
publication.

## What Changes

### Immediate (Pre-Release)

1. **GitHub Token Setup** - Enable automated GitHub releases
2. **Update tasks.md** - Mark all completed items
3. **Audit package.json** - Ensure correct metadata
4. **Test npm package** - Verify package contents before publish
5. **Create GitHub Release** - v0.1.1 release with notes

### Post-Release (Optional)

6. **GitHub Actions CI/CD** - Automated testing on push
7. **Additional examples** - Python/Flutter projects (optional)
8. **Cross-platform testing** - Validate on Windows/Linux (optional)

## Impact

**Affected specs:**

- None (polish and release preparation only)

**Affected code:**

- `package.json` - Metadata verification
- `.release-it.json` - GitHub token configuration
- `openspec/changes/implement-telos-multi-agent-system/tasks.md` - Update
  checklist
- `.github/workflows/` (NEW) - CI/CD if implemented

**User Journey:**

Current:

```
User: npm install -g telos-framework
Error: Package not published yet
```

After:

```
User: npm install -g telos-framework
✓ telos-framework@0.1.1 installed
User: telos init
✓ Works perfectly
```

**Breaking changes:** None

**Dependencies:**

- GitHub personal access token (for automated releases)
- npm account with publish rights (already configured)
