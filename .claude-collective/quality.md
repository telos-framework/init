# Quality Assurance and Validation

## Phase Gate Requirements
- All subtasks must complete successfully
- Test contracts must pass validation
- Research metrics must be collected
- Documentation must be updated
- No directive violations recorded

## Handoff Validation Contracts
```javascript
// Example handoff contract
const handoffContract = {
  requiredContext: ["user_request", "analysis_results", "selected_agent"],
  validationRules: ["context_completeness", "agent_availability", "capability_match"],
  successCriteria: ["implementation_complete", "tests_passing", "metrics_collected"],
  fallbackProcedures: ["retry_with_context", "escalate_to_manager", "report_failure"]
};
```

## TDD Completion Reporting Standard

All implementation agents use standardized TDD completion reporting:

```
## ðŸš€ DELIVERY COMPLETE - TDD APPROACH
âœ… Tests written first (RED phase)
âœ… Implementation passes all tests (GREEN phase)
âœ… Code refactored for quality (REFACTOR phase)
ðŸ“Š Test Results: [X]/[Y] passing
```

## Implementation Coverage
- **@component-implementation-agent**: UI component completion reporting
- **@feature-implementation-agent**: Business logic completion reporting  
- **@infrastructure-implementation-agent**: Build system completion reporting
- **@polish-implementation-agent**: Optimization completion reporting
- **@devops-agent**: Deployment completion reporting
- **@quality-agent**: Quality validation completion reporting
- **@completion-gate**: Task validation completion reporting
- **@enhanced-quality-gate**: Quality gate completion reporting

## Hub Controller Responsibility
**CRITICAL**: The hub controller MUST display the complete TDD completion report to users exactly as received from agents. Never summarize, truncate, or paraphrase these reports - they are a key competitive differentiator.

## Competitive Advantage
This standardized reporting makes our TDD methodology highly visible, demonstrating:
- Rigorous test-first development approach
- Comprehensive quality assurance
- Professional development practices
- Measurable test coverage and quality metrics
