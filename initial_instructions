## Implementation Considerations

We are providing a generic framework; which tools we plug in at the different levels needs to be discovered and negotiated with the user during an initialization phase.

We must deeply build out the the structure from top to bottom. Accurately and comprehensibly capturing the project telos is of utmost importance. From there, 

Reference the [Claude Collective](https://github.com/vanzan01/claude-code-sub-agent-collective) to understand
- How to structure Agents
- How to structure delegation and reporting between agents
- How to structure tool calling

You can find an example of this in /Users/alancolver/dev/annuity/cloud-resources/.claude-collective

Tool Discovery
- We should work with the user to discover what tools are available
- We should also prescribe certain (nearly) indispensable tools such as
	- Web search
	- Documentation search (via context7)
	- Browser use
	- Others?

Work with various coding platforms. The way purplestack handles this by having a top level AGENTS.md and then symlinking other references (like .cursor, CLAUDE.md, etc). Reference the symlinking structure of /Users/alancolver/dev/auraone to discover how to set this up (i.e. many symlinks pointing to mobile-app/tools/content/CONTEXT.md)

We should consider the structure to record the context (telos, tools, etc) in structured Markdown files in a prescriptive manner. The logos agent may periodically update these as it interacts with the human user.

Our goal is to share this with the world (MIT license). Structure as a simple, well-documented Github repo. Create a top-level README.md and have simple commands to import, initialize (go through a discovery phase with the user for things like telos, available MCPs, existing code/platforms, preferences on styles and coding languages, etc).
