# Feature: User Authentication

## TELOS ALIGNMENT

**Contributes to**: Empower users to securely access and manage their content

**Via**:

- L9: Ultimate purpose - secure, user-controlled platform
- L8: Business value - reduce support costs, increase user trust
- L7: User insight - users need secure, easy login
- L6: UX requirement - seamless authentication experience
- L5: Workflow - complete signup/login/logout flows
- L4: API contracts - authentication service endpoints
- L3: Components - login form, signup form, auth state provider
- L2: Functions - hash password, validate token, check session
- L1: Code quality - secure coding practices, no plaintext passwords

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Secure Password Storage

Passwords SHALL be hashed using bcrypt with minimum 12 rounds.

#### Scenario: User registers with password

- **WHEN** user submits registration form with password
- **THEN** password is hashed before storage, plaintext never persisted

#### Scenario: User logs in

- **WHEN** user submits login credentials
- **THEN** submitted password is compared against stored hash

### Requirement: Session Management

Sessions SHALL expire after 24 hours of inactivity.

#### Scenario: Active user session

- **WHEN** user performs action within 24 hours
- **THEN** session is extended for another 24 hours

#### Scenario: Inactive session

- **WHEN** 24 hours pass without activity
- **THEN** session is invalidated, user must re-authenticate

### Requirement: Token-Based Authentication

API SHALL use JWT tokens for stateless authentication.

#### Scenario: Successful authentication

- **WHEN** user provides valid credentials
- **THEN** JWT token is issued with user claims

#### Scenario: Protected API access

- **WHEN** client makes API request with valid token
- **THEN** request is authorized and processed

## TOOLS REQUIRED

- **L1**: ESLint (security rules), Prettier
- **L2**: Vitest (unit tests for auth functions)
- **L3**: React Testing Library (component tests)
- **L4**: Supertest (API endpoint testing)
- **L5**: Playwright (E2E auth flows)

## Implementation Tasks

1. **L1**: Review code for security vulnerabilities
2. **L2**: Implement password hashing, token generation, session validation
   functions
3. **L3**: Build LoginForm, SignupForm, AuthProvider components
4. **L4**: Create /auth/signup, /auth/login, /auth/logout endpoints
5. **L5**: Test complete authentication workflows
6. **L6**: Verify UX meets accessibility standards
7. **L9**: Confirm feature serves ultimate Telos

## Success Criteria

- All unit tests pass (>90% coverage for auth functions)
- All E2E tests pass (signup, login, logout, session expiry)
- Security audit passes (no plaintext passwords, proper token handling)
- Telos-Guardian approves alignment with secure access mission
